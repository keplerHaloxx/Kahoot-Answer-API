# Warning!
I can't be bothered documenting this code so it looks really bad. If anyone wants to open a pull request and document my crappy code then thank you.

# Kahoot-Answer-Class

If you want to use the script I made using the api, run `Main.py`. You can also use the `KahootClass.py` file to make your own version.

## ❓How To Use❓
You can either use `KahootClass.py` to use the class for yourself
or you can run `Main.py` where the code has been written already.
Firstly, you need the quizId (not the game pin).
To get the quizId, look up at the host's screen and look at the link,
at the end it will say 'quizId=(quizId is here)'.
